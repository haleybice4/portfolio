None of the Above
1
print("Hello World") would correctly display "Hello World".
Question 3 Data Types
If x = 3 What data type would x be?

String
1
x would be an Integer.
Question 4 Printing

Print("THIS","IS","THE","WRONG","ANSWER")
print(Hello + World)
PRINT("Hello " + "World")
1
Option 1 would be correct due to not haveing a syntax error.
Question 5 Lists & Tuples
Which of the following correctly assigns a variable to a list? NOT a tuple.
list1 = ["Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"]
list2 = "Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"
list3 = ("Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3")
None of these are lists
1
Option 1 would correctly assign a variable to a list.
Question 6 Lists & Tuples
Which of the following correctly assigns a variable to a tuple? NOT a list.
tuple1 = ("Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3")
tuple2 = "Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"
tuple3 = ["Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"]
4 None of these are tuples
1
Option 1 would correctly assign a variable to a tuple.
Question 7 If statments
When useing If statments how do you specify specific code to run if it is true?
You indent the code you want to run
You capitalize the code
You you indent the first line only
None of these are correct
1
Option 1 would be correct because after the If statment the following code you want to run would be indented.
Question 8 Spacing
How many spaces is the standard indent in our classroom?

6 spaces
3 spaces
1
We indent our code with four spaces

print
for
valid variable
1
pizza is a valid variable it does not have a space and is not already used by python, it also tastes good.
Question 11 Special Characters
Should you put special characters directly into your code? (Infinity, Omega, Copywrite symbols, ect..)
No
Yes
when nameing a variable
when creating a class
1
You should not put special characters into your code because python would not recognize them.
Question 12 Functions
What is a Function?
A block of code you can use later in your program
A series of mathmaticle operations to get a specific output
Some language arts thing you don't know about
None of the Above
1
Functions are blocks of code that can be use later in your program.
Question 13 History

Is there a logical error in this code? if 1 < 0:
Yes have you ever taken math?
No nothing is wrong
No but there is a syntax error
None of the Above
1
well obvioulsy 1 is alwas greater than 0 so there is a logical error in the code.
Question 18 Learning
